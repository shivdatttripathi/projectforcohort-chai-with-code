How It Works
The application fetches videos from the API based on the current page.
The fetched videos are stored in localStorage for quick access.
The videos are displayed as cards, showing thumbnails, titles, and a button to visit the YouTube channel.
Users can navigate through pages using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
The search bar filters the displayed videos without making additional API requests.
